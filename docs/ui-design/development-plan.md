# Development Plan

## 1. Objective

This document turns the UI design into an implementation plan.

It answers three questions:

1. How should frontend and backend be developed in waves?
2. What should be built first versus deferred?
3. How can the product support iterative updates from any step without creating state chaos?

## 2. Development Principle

Build the UI as a thin, useful layer over the existing AutoR workflow before attempting large internal refactors.

That means:

- do not rebuild the research engine first
- do not invent new hidden workflow state
- expose existing run data to the UI quickly
- only add new metadata where the current repo model is missing an obvious concept

## 3. Delivery Waves

## Wave 0: Service Adapter Layer

### Goal

Make the current Python workflow readable and controllable from a web UI.

### Current branch status

Partially implemented.

Delivered now:

- `src/studio_service.py`
- `src/studio_http.py`
- `studio_web/index.html`
- `studio_web/styles.css`
- `studio_web/app.js`
- `tests/test_studio_service.py`
- `tests/test_studio_http.py`

Covered in the current implementation:

- project index storage
- project summaries for a project hub view
- fixed human-in-the-loop participation at the project layer
- run summary loading
- stage document access
- workspace file tree construction
- read-only file content preview loading
- iteration planning for continue, redo, and branch with generated execution briefs
- manuscript preview metadata plus PDF streaming
- derived version history plus normalized execution trace events
- a lightweight local JSON HTTP adapter for the first read-oriented UI flows
- a lightweight local browser shell split into Overview, Human Review, Files, Paper, and Versions pages
- improved markdown rendering for stage and note previews

Still planned, not implemented in this branch:

- live trace streaming
- named milestones and restore actions
- browser-triggered rerun / approval writes
- in-browser manuscript editing and compile actions
- VS Code / Overleaf handoff buttons

Current launcher options:

```bash
python studio.py --repo-root . --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

or

```bash
python -m src.studio_http --repo-root . --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

### Backend work

- create FastAPI app

### Acceptance bar

- UI can open an existing run
- UI can show stages, files, artifacts, and paper preview
- UI can generate a clean iteration brief for human-in-the-loop refinement
- UI can resume or rollback a run once write actions land

## Wave 1: Project Hub And Run Workspace

### Goal

### Backend work

- named milestone storage
- branch point creation
- version diff endpoint
- restore endpoint
- scoped iteration endpoint

### Frontend work

## Wave 5: Polish And Reliability

### Goal

Make the product feel robust for daily use.

### Backend work

- worker supervision
- retry policies
- better event compaction
- performance tuning for large run folders

### Frontend work

- keyboard shortcuts
- better empty states
- better loading states
- accessibility pass
- small quality-of-life touches

## 4. Frontend And Backend Ownership Split

### Frontend should own

- navigation
- layout state
- selected project and run
- pane state
- editor state
- optimistic interaction state

### Backend should own

- run lifecycle
- stage transitions
- filesystem reads and writes
- trace normalization
- compile execution
- version persistence

### Shared contracts

- status enums
- stage identifiers
- event payloads
- version metadata schema

## 5. Recommended Implementation Order Inside Each Wave

The order should always be:

1. backend schema
2. backend endpoint
3. frontend read view
4. frontend action
5. event handling
6. reload and recovery validation

This prevents flashy screens with weak runtime behavior.

## 6. The Core Iteration Model

The product needs one clean mental model for “iterate from here”.

### Iteration object

Every iteration request should declare:

- target run
- target step
- target scope
- iteration mode
- freeze rules
- output destination

### Suggested request shape

```json
{
  "run_id": "20260406_101245",
  "base_stage_slug": "07_writing",
  "scope_type": "file",
  "scope_value": "workspace/writing/sections/method.tex",
  "mode": "branch",
  "freeze_upstream": true,
  "invalidate_downstream": false,
  "user_feedback": "Tighten the method narrative and clarify the operator loop."
}
```

## 7. Iteration Modes

### Mode 1: Refine current stage

Use when:

- the stage is already active
- the user wants another attempt

Effects:

- same run
- same stage
- increment attempt count

### Mode 2: Redo from selected stage

Use when:

- the user wants to rerun from stage N
- downstream state should no longer be trusted

Effects:

- same run
- target stage becomes dirty
- downstream stages become stale

### Mode 3: Branch from selected stage

Use when:

- the user wants an alternative path
- the approved baseline must remain intact

Effects:

- new run or sub-run lineage
- upstream context copied or linked
- downstream recomputed in branch only

### Mode 4: Scoped writing iteration

Use when:

- the user wants to update only a manuscript section or a figure explanation

Effects:

- branch point or scoped patch workflow
- unchanged sections remain frozen
- rebuild writing outputs

## 8. Decision Logic For “Start From Step X”

The UI should ask one clarifying question only:

**Do you want to update the current run, or create a new branch?**

After that, the logic is deterministic.

### If update current run

- if target is current stage, continue in place
- if target is earlier stage, rollback and redo
- mark downstream stale

### If create new branch

- save a checkpoint
- record branch lineage
- continue from target stage in the new branch

## 9. Safe Iteration Rules

Before starting any iteration job, the backend should:

1. create an auto checkpoint
2. validate the target scope exists
3. calculate what becomes stale
4. show the user a summary of affected files and stages
5. record the iteration request in metadata

Without these steps, the UI will feel unpredictable.

## 10. Partial Iteration Rules By Scope

| Scope | Example | Frozen | Recomputed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stage | `06_analysis` | stages 01-05 | 06 onward |
| file | `sections/method.tex` | upstream stage state | selected file plus dependent writing build |
| subtree | `workspace/figures/` | run context | selected subtree and manifests |
| manuscript | `07_writing` | 01-06 | writing and dissemination |

## 11. Reload And Recovery Requirements

Every wave must support hard refresh recovery.

### Required tests

- refresh during active run
- refresh during compile
- refresh during waiting-for-approval state
- refresh after rollback
- refresh after branch creation

If the screen cannot reconstruct cleanly after reload, the wave is incomplete.

## 12. Suggested Milestones

### Milestone A

Read-only product shell.

Includes:

- projects
- runs
- stage rail
- files
- artifact browser

### Milestone B

Interactive run control.

Includes:

- approve
- refine
- rollback
- live trace

### Milestone C

Writing-first workflow.

Includes:

- source editor
- PDF preview
- compile log
- packaging

### Milestone D

Versioning and branching.

Includes:

- checkpoints
- named milestones
- compare
- restore
- branch from stage

## 13. Suggested Team Split

If two people are building this in parallel:

### Track 1

- backend service layer
- run orchestration endpoints
- event streaming
- version metadata

### Track 2

- app shell
- project hub
- run workspace
- writing studio

They can converge on shared schemas and event contracts.

## 14. Minimum Test Matrix

### Backend

- create run
- resume run
- rollback from stage
- approve stage
- refine stage
- compile writing
- create version
- restore version
- branch from stage

### Frontend

- open project
- open run
- switch tabs
- receive live event
- reload during active state
- open PDF preview
- compare versions

## 15. Recommended First Build Target

If only one thin but useful slice is built first, it should be:

**Project Hub + Run Workspace + Stage actions**

Reason:

- it exposes the core AutoR value immediately
- it uses the current repository model directly
- it avoids getting blocked on the full writing studio too early

After that, the writing studio becomes the next highest-value slice.
