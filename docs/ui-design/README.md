# AutoR UI Initial Design

This folder contains the first UI design pass for a graphical AutoR product that stays faithful to the current codebase.

The design direction is intentionally practical:

- calm, clear, and dense enough for serious research work
- better at project control and artifact inspection than at visual spectacle
- familiar where needed, borrowing the good parts of Overleaf, VS Code, Linear, Cursor, and NotebookLM
- optimized for long-running research workflows with human checkpoints

## What Exists In The Current Codebase

The design is grounded in real repository concepts, not imaginary product objects.

| Current source of truth | What it means in product terms | Proposed UI surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runs/<run_id>/run_manifest.json` | run status, stage state, attempts, approvals, stale/dirty state | stage rail, run overview, project dashboard |
| `runs/<run_id>/stages/*.md` | approved stage summaries | stage summary reader, review mode, version compare |
| `runs/<run_id>/logs.txt` and `logs_raw.jsonl` | human-readable logs and event stream | trace timeline, debug console, event inspector |
| `runs/<run_id>/operator_state/*` | session IDs, attempts, recovery state | execution metadata drawer |
| `runs/<run_id>/artifact_index.json` | structured data, result, and figure inventory | artifact explorer, evidence browser |
| `runs/<run_id>/workspace/` | the actual research payload | file tree, read-only preview, external handoff |
| `runs/<run_id>/workspace/writing/main.tex` and `main.pdf` | manuscript source and compiled output | Overleaf-style writing studio |
| `runs/<run_id>/memory.md` and `handoff/*.md` | cross-stage memory and handoff | context panel, provenance panel |

## Product Thesis

AutoR should feel like a research operating system, not a chat window with extra tabs.

The core UX unit should become:

`Project -> Run -> Stage -> Artifact -> Version`

Not:

`Chat -> Chat -> More Chat`

That change matters because AutoR already stores durable state on disk. The UI should expose that structure directly.

## Primary Users

- a researcher running several experiments or paper efforts at once
- a human supervisor steering a long AutoR run with stage-by-stage approval
- a writing-heavy user who needs LaTeX source, compiled PDF, build logs, and evidence side by side

## Initial Scope

This first design pass covers the features you requested:

- multiple research project management
- human-in-the-loop execution with explicit review checkpoints
- traceable execution history
- reload and recovery
- labeled saved versions
- partial iteration on a selected stage or section
- Overleaf-style LaTeX compile plus PDF display
- VS Code-style file and artifact exploration

## Prototype Gallery

These prototypes are intended as visual mood boards and layout references, not final pixel-perfect screens.
They were generated locally on April 9, 2026 with Gemini image models, so the layout and visual hierarchy are meaningful but some small text inside the mockups is illustrative only.

### 1. Project Hub

![Project Hub Prototype](./assets/01-project-hub.png)

What this screen solves:

- manage many research efforts at once
- see active run status immediately
- jump into paused or blocked work
- separate projects from individual runs

### 2. Research Workspace

![Research Workspace Prototype](./assets/02-run-workspace.png)

What this screen solves:

- stage progression and approval
- file and artifact inspection
- human chat and agent trace in one surface
- quick jumps between evidence, files, and logs

### 3. Writing Studio

![Writing Studio Prototype](./assets/03-writing-studio.png)

What this screen solves:

- LaTeX editing with compiled PDF
- build logs and citation checks
- SyncTeX-style source-to-preview workflow
- manuscript-focused iteration

### 4. Version And Trace Review

![Version And Trace Prototype](./assets/04-version-trace.png)

What this screen solves:

- save and label versions
- inspect stage-level deltas
- restore old states without losing provenance
- compare execution paths

## Recommended App Structure

```text

├── Projects
│   ├── All Projects
│   ├── Active Runs
│   ├── Waiting For Approval
│   └── Archived
├── Workspace
│   ├── Run Overview

```

## Main Layout Pattern

The most useful default is a four-zone layout:

```text
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Top bar: project switcher | run status | search | primary actions | review queue |
+------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------+----------------+
| Left rail  | Main working pane             | Secondary pane            | Right inspector |
| Projects   | editor / stage summary / PDF  | trace / artifact preview  | details / diff  |
| Files      |                               |                           | approvals       |
| Stages     |                               |                           | metadata        |
+------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------+----------------+
| Bottom utility bar: compile log | terminal | raw events | task queue | notifications   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This combines:

- VS Code's strong left-side navigation and panel grammar
- Overleaf's source/PDF duality
- Linear's project and status clarity
- Cursor's agent-status mental model

## Human-In-The-Loop Invariant

Projects should not be classified as `Human` versus `AutoR`.

The correct product model is:

- every project is human-in-the-loop
- every run can continue automatically between review checkpoints
- stage approvals, scoped reruns, and manuscript iteration still return to a human decision point

That keeps AutoR aligned with the current repository and avoids implying a fully unattended project mode.

## Design Principles

1. Show durable objects first.
   Projects, runs, stages, artifacts, and versions should be visible before raw chat.

2. Keep provenance attached to every action.
   Every figure, file, diff, and paper section should show which run and which stage produced it.

3. Favor split views over modal churn.
   Research work depends on cross-checking evidence, code, logs, and writing side by side.

4. Make recovery first-class.
   Reload, rollback, rerun, restore, and partial iteration should feel normal, not hidden.

5. Let the interface get dense only after the user asks for it.
   New users see a calm project view. Power users can open trace, raw logs, and metadata drawers.

## Implementation Status

The first backend-oriented slice is now implemented in the repository:

- `src/studio_service.py`
- `src/studio_http.py`
- `studio_web/index.html`
- `studio_web/styles.css`
- `studio_web/app.js`
- `tests/test_studio_service.py`
- `tests/test_studio_http.py`

This initial slice now covers a first usable local studio shell:

- project index storage
- human-in-the-loop project summaries
- project summaries with active-run status
- run summary loading
- stage document loading
- a split `Overview / Human Review / Files / Paper` browser shell
- workspace file tree browsing
- read-only file content preview with improved markdown rendering
- human iteration planning for continue, redo, and branch with generated execution briefs
- direct manuscript preview with PDF embedding, section listing, and build-log display
- a first read-only `Versions` view backed by derived checkpoints and execution trace events
- local JSON HTTP endpoints for projects, runs, stages, files, artifacts, and iteration planning
- a zero-dependency local UI shell that consumes those endpoints
- a simple local launcher via `python studio.py --repo-root . --port 8765`

Not implemented yet, despite appearing in the design docs:

- named milestone persistence
- restore / branch write actions from the browser
- live SSE trace streaming
- in-browser file editing
- compile actions from the Paper page
- VS Code / Overleaf handoff buttons

The next logical step is to wire write actions into this shell: stage approvals, reruns, branch creation, LaTeX compile, and external handoff into VS Code or Overleaf.

## Suggested Build Order

1. Project Hub
2. Human Review controls
3. Read-only Files plus external handoff
4. Writing Studio with compile actions
5. Stage rail plus approval controls
6. Version history and restore actions
7. Trace inspector with live updates
8. Partial iteration write flows
